###SCR - Slope Conversion of Resistance for resistance-based sensors

This project explores the Slope Conversion of Resistance method to 
implement a "Light Sensor" - a microcontroller (MSP430) based node 
that measures the light intensity over time. More specifically, 
it has been used to build a sunlight measuring device that helps 
determine how many hours of sunlight certain location spot gets per 
day.

Same method and most part of the implementation can be easily 
adapted to be used with other resistance-based sensors such as 
thermistors and force-sensitive resistors.
