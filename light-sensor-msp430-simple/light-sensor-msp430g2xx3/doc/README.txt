This is a light sensor implementation, using a CdS LDR photoresistor,
based on the SCR method and the MSP430 microcontroller.

Hardware:

    o MSP430G2553
    o LDR resistor between pins 6 and 7;
    o Capacitor 0.1u between pin 7 and GND.
    o Watch crystal between pins 18 and 19;
    o LEDs and everything else - as on the Launchpad.
